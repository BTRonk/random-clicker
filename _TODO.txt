missing cookie clicker features

implement currencies other than crackers

buy/upgrade costs based on formula instead of static? so we tweak it in game settings for fast/slow progress

original feature ideas:
- more achievements
- something involving achievements * cps
-- equivalent of kittens upgrades
- some kind of meta/prestige mechanic & currency
- equivalent of cookie clicker prestige features
-- golden cracker upgrades
-- misc heavenly chip upgrades
