figure out how to offload default data into an external js file without breaking shit
WHY THE FUCK WON'T THE VALUES RESET TO THE FILE VALUES EVEN WHEN I COPY THE OBJECT

move option names/descriptions to config file & use v-for in template

look into using parent/child variables instead of events to pass certain data around

core features TODO
- menu
-- stats page (track more data)
--- total crackers earned
--- golden cracker stats/attributes

performance
- account for autoclickers and limit particle generation/updates if necessary
- learn about js performance profiling to find bottlenecks (game gets really laggy in later stages)

upgrade checklist
DONE:
- building 0 production
- base production
- clicking
- x of every building
NOT DONE:
- rest of the income multiplers (dark chocolate-coated cookies+)
- building 1 forms (grandma types)
- synergies (heavenly upgrade)
- kitten upgrades
- golden cracker upgrades
- heavenly chip upgrades

achivement todo
- building achievements
- click achievements
- click speed

juice/improvements
- break stuff off into other components if possible 
-- refactor new/load/save system (turn into component)
- flavor texts - what if i sourced them from reddit thread titles or something?
- upgrade/achievement costs based on formula instead of static? that way we could tweak it in game settings for fast/slow

9E = billion
12E = trillion
